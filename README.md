Resources and development for Natural Language Processing in Question Answering datasets from work: "Characterization and automatic prediction of diﬁculty in Question Answering collections based on Neural Language Models".

Question answering evolution is due to the explosion of challenging datasets requiring world knowledge to answer. Recently, pre-trained neural network language models such as BERT, RoBERTa and T5 have greatly improved on the results of previous approaches. However, error analysis of this models is scarce and and does not allow to know in which aspects can be improved or what type of questions pose the greatest diﬃculty. 

To address this problem, in this work is proposed the automatic linguistic characterization of several datasets used for ﬁne-tunning this models such as SQuAD, NewsQA and RACE, and a study associating the mistakes and successes made by various models on these collections. In addition, a methodology for automatic annotation of the complexity of question collections is proposed based on the diﬃculties the pose to various systems. Finally, several predictive models based on Machine Learning are evaluated to study the ability to predict the annotation proposed in this work. In this way, it is intended to advance in the studies on how to improve the results in Question Answering by the current systems.
